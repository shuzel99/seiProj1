# InstaCart inspired game

## Elevator Pitch
The player is an instacart-esque shopper. The game board has a supermarket backdrop and items from a specified order will come up in the left upper corner one by one. A cascade of different vegetables and groceries will come down from the top of the screen and users have to manuver a cart to catch the grocery item matching the one being shown in the left corner matching the instacart order. Incorrect groceries are able to be added to the cart causing a loss of points. A certain number of lost points results in the instacart shopper being fired.

## Tech Stack
The game will be made using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and whimsical.

## MVP Goals
Render the grocery cart 

Have a randomly generated item representing items on the instacart order

Render randomly cascading grocery items from the top of the screen

Track items that collide with the cart and recognize items matching the randomly generated item from the order

Add points when matching item is in cart, subtract points when other item is in cart, player loses when points reach zero.

## Stretch Goals
Differentiate between good groceries and bad groceries (order calls for a peach and game cascades different groceries including regular peaches and bruised peaches). Bad groceries result in a loss of points.

Have each level be under a time constraint. 

Have groceries be brand specific 

## Potential Roadblocks 
Every aspect is a potential road block I have zero clue how I'm going to do this at all :).
